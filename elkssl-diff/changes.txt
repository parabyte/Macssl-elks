changes iv had to make.
=====================

Core renames and configuration
- Replaced the original Mac-focused compatibility layer with ELKS-neutral headers
  (`Project/mbedtls_compat.h`, `Project/elkssl_stdint.h`).
- Rewrote `Project/config.h` for ELKS TLS 1.2 client support and direct libc hooks.
- Added `entropy_elks.c` stubbed hardware entropy source.

Build tooling
- Added `build-elks-elkssl.sh` OpenWatcom build script producing `build-elks/lib/elkssl.lib`
  and staged headers.
- Normalised line endings to LF across sources for Watcom compatibility.

Library adjustments
- Extensive portability edits across Mbed TLS sources to remove Mac-specific
  assumptions, enforce 16-bit size-safety, and fix OpenWatcom warnings in ASN.1,
  Base64, CTR_DRBG, SSL, OID, PK parsing, and X.509 modules.
- Routed platform allocation/printf calls directly to the ELKS C library.

Documentation
- Replaced README with ELKSSL-specific guidance and build instructions.
